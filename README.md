# Real Time Kinematics Base Station Manager
### RTKBaseManager
Configure ESP WiFi credentials and other default values for a RTK base station. It runs as an access point if no credentials are saved, (SSID: "rtkbase", IP: 192.168.4.1). Fill the web form with your data, save and reboot. After restart the device is reachable as a client in your local network (http://rtkbase.local or local IP).
This is a submodule of the [RTKBaseStation](https://github.com/audio-communication-group/RTKBaseStation).
